This game was made in 9 days using Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition and the SFML 2.4 library.

It does not create a link in your Start Menu or my Programs. Notate the installation folder when you install it.

The next version may come as a single standalone executable. 

It was coded in C++ for a module at Edinburgh Napier University. This was createed to meet some technical criteria and is not balanced OR designed with features that I would have liked to have in a better final product. 

This game is compatible with most joysticks that use Microsoft signed drivers, including the Xbox 360 and Xbox ONE controllers. 

Joystick controls:

A -> Fire
B -> Back (Menus only)
Start -> Pause

D-PAD -> Ship movement and menu navigation

Left Joystick -> Ship Movement only

Keyboard Controls:

Arrow Keys -> Menu and ship movement
Right Control -> Confirm on Menus
ENTER (keypad) -> Fire 
P -> Pause
ESC -> Exit Game 


Pressing start will begin the game. Avoid the enemy ships while shooting them. Stay alive as long as possible. Game increases with difficulty each second. Balance and gameplay design were not the the focus of this submission. 

Glitches: Due to time constraints there are some glitches in the gameplay and menu options. 

-The shield powerup (small bubble) spawns about 600 pixels below where it shows on screen. 
-Pressing the Options button before starting the game will not show the fullscreen option and may lock the cursor.
-There are no bounds for flying off screen (not a glitch, just skipped for time)
-The Credits button does nothing (skipped for time)

There will be anotehr submission for the end of the semester that will be made over the course of 12 weeks with better quality, design, and balance. Please look forward to the next project and think of this as a Game Jam style submission.


The following are the art and music licenses. All art and music not created by me is credited below.

Thanks for taking the time to try my first game created from (mostly) scratch.
